He could **propel his world into the future** with a mere thought, though a limitation haunted his omnipotence — he could **never return back**.\n\nOne day, a silent vessel descended, bearing **an alien named Torricelli**. He presented the King with a curious object: **a trumpet of impossible dimensions**. It began with a wide opening but tapered away into an infinitely long, infinitely thin horn.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/824/1*ZzrF_jljEqdTmZ_TXW1ZpQ.png)\nTorricelli ‘s Trumpet**Torricelli **made a simple, yet profound request: that his trumpet be coated in **Demood’s** most prized substance, the** “Royal Water of Logic.”** To the King, this was no mere request , it was a challenge to his dominion over the physical world. His pride stirred, but caution bade him first consult the sharpest minds on the planet.\n\nThe **Grand Geometer** approached the throne after careful deliberation. “My Lord,” he began, “this bizarre shape is a physical representation of the function **y = 1/x, rotated 360 degrees about the x-axis, from x = 1 to infinity.**”\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-LQAAACRUqBX3quM3SmI_A.png)\ngraph of y = 1/xHe continued, explaining that on** Demood**,** where atoms were theoretical points, the Royal Water could flow into the most infinitesimal of spaces.** The mathematician then presented his calculations for the trumpet’s volume.\n\nThe volume is given by the integral as in the figure below. When we solve this, **we get a finite, almost trivial amount**.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ijDu_gBbkRDXgaT_7s63gQ.jpeg)\nIntuition behind the formula used to calculate volume\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/949/1*i9NOgc9SKBHfdtI8BfoUBw.png)\nTotal volume enclosed by trumpet**“A volume of exactly π cubic units!” **the mathematician chuckled. **“My Lord, not only can we coat this trumpet, we can fill it from the inside and gift the water to the alien!”**\n\nBolstered by this finite answer, the King’s ego swelled. He accepted the challenge. First, to demonstrate his power, he decided to fill the trumpet. With a flick of his wrist and a whisper of enchanted words, time elapsed, and the trumpet was filled with precisely π cubic units of the Royal Water. Torricelli watched, impassive.\n\nNow for the main task: coating the infinite exterior. In his haste and supreme confidence, the King uttered the enchanting words to coat the surface, but in his hubris, he forgot a crucial parameter: **the thickness of the coating. The magic interpreted the command as coating an infinite surface with a finite thickness ‘t’ ( though ‘t’ was as small as you can think of but not zero).**\n\nA silent, terrifying vortex erupted from the trumpet. The Royal Water of Logic, the lifeblood of **Demood**, was ripped from its lakes, its rivers, even the very cells of its flora and fauna. In a horrifying instant, the vibrant world was desiccated. The lush planet became a barren, grey sphere of dust. **The King watched in shock as his beautiful kingdom vanished, consumed by his command.**\n\nHe stood alone on the barren land, a terrible thirst gripping him. Parched and in despair, he remembered the finite water trapped *within* the trumpet. As he tipped the trumpet to pour the final, precious drop,** his eyes caught the formula for the surface area,** hidden within the trumpet itself — a detail no one had warned him about, and one he had never thought to question.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/646/1*NPznF-D1ylPTl-Cf6VyzdQ.png)\nTotal surface area of trumpet (interior or exterior) is not finite\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0Dp1sOzwMJrDe3t7zJZ5Qw.jpeg)\nIntuition behind formula used to calculate surface areaIn that moment, the King understood the terrible truth. He had filled a **finite volume** of water inside the trumpet, but the **surface he tried to coat was infinite**. No matter how much he poured, **the interior coating’s thickness decreased as x grew larger, approaching zero at infinity**. The inside of the trumpet was covered automatically as it filled, but the outside surface demanded an **infinite amount of water**( he could have coated the exterior if he decreased the coating thickness as x increases).\n\nThe King was left with nothing but a dry planet and a dreadful new knowledge. One has to wonder: How many more trumpets did Torricelli carry? How many other worlds, ruled by pride, did he visit? Was Demood a victim of Torricelli’s cunning or the King’s foolishness? Or perhaps, in the end, a planet whose very name — **Demood** — is **Doomed** spelled in reverse was simply fulfilling its destiny.\n\n## Ponder a bit :\nWhy did we approximate a small portion of Gabriel’s Horn (trumpet) as a **cylinder** when calculating volume, but as a **frustum of a cone** when calculating surface area?*Hint:* For volume, the contribution of a thin slice depends mainly on its **cross-sectional area**, so treating it as a cylinder is sufficient. For surface area, the **slant or tilt of the surface** matters, so a frustum better approximates the curved geometry. (Rigorous proofs are available online)Is it possible to construct a smooth surface, similar to Gabriel’s Horn, that has **infinite volume but finite surface area?**[Gabriel’s horn — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel%27s_horn#Converse)## References :\n[Gabriel’s horn — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel%27s_horn)[https://youtu.be/yZOi9HH5ueU](https://youtu.be/yZOi9HH5ueU)\n![Image](https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b955b6d86390)\n[Torricelli’s Trumpet: A Story of Pride, Mathematics, and Infinity](https://medium.com/stamatics-iit-kanpur/torricellis-trumpet-a-story-of-pride-mathematics-and-infinity-b955b6d86390) was originally published in [Stamatics, IIT Kanpur](https://medium.com/stamatics-iit-kanpur) on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.\n\n"},{"id":"the-beauty-of-continued-fractions","title":"The Beauty of Continued Fractions","author":"Anubhabgoswami","date":"2025-03-17T15:18:37.000Z","content":"It often feels like patterns in nature emerge effortlessly, waiting for a mathematician to observe, analyze, and uncover their deeper meaning.

All you need is a piece of paper, a pencil, and a needle or matchstick. Begin by drawing several parallel lines on the paper, ensuring that the spacing between them equals the length of the needle.\n\nNow, close your eyes and randomly drop the needle onto the paper. Observe whether the needle intersects any of the lines. Repeat this process ***N ***times (you can choose ***N ***based on your laziness 😆).

These methods leverage repeated random sampling to approximate complex mathematical results. Let’s delve into the mathematics of this problem and see how it unveils the value of **Pi **.\n\n**Before we proceed, let’s clarify the assumptions. Since you are dropping the needle with your eyes closed (I trust you ! 😃), we assume that each drop is completely random, both in position and orientation. Additionally, regardless of where the needle lands, we can abstract the problem by considering only the cases where the needle falls between two particular adjacent lines.**## The Probability of Intersection\nNow, consider the center of the needle. The probability that the center falls at a distance between *x* and *x+****d****x* from the nearest parallel line is:\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/504/1*fcjIhOAvp6bmf5qaYmO-uw.png)\n**The needle will intersect a parallel line if the angle it makes with a line perpendicular to the parallel lines is below a certain threshold, as illustrated in the figure below.**\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/892/1*gGyFT6BKZn4yazQDk5pBpA.jpeg)\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1014/1*EpQ9g-L_wWgTVgZPKG4tmA.png)\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/934/1*qoI5K9f5O2i3EwO19rDXpQ.png)\nSumming up the probabilities as ***x ***varies from ***0 ***to ***l/2 ***, we get\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/496/1*TDYOSBb6gxdGCZvtWlK0xg.png)\n***Thus, solving for ***π***, we get ***π ***is approximately equal to 2 / Observed probability ***≈ ***2*N/I***## Conclusion\nBy conducting this simple needle-dropping experiment, we have uncovered a **surprising method to approximate** π ! 🤯 This approach, famously known as **Buffon’s Needle problem**, is one of the earliest examples of a **Monte Carlo method** — an idea that has since revolutionized fields from **physics** to **finance**.\n\n## Next time you need to approximate π, you might just reach for a needle instead of a formula! 😉\nFor a more generalized formulation of Buffon’s Needle, refer to [Buffon’s Needle Problem — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem).\n\n\n![Image](https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f5c70349a710)\n[Sew the Pi](https://medium.com/stamatics-iit-kanpur/sew-the-pi-f5c70349a710) was originally published in [Stamatics, IIT Kanpur](https://medium.com/stamatics-iit-kanpur) on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.\n\n"},{"id":"a-gentle-introduction-to-game-theory","title":"A Gentle Introduction To Game Theory","author":"Mainak Sarkar","date":"2025-02-18T17:16:07.000Z","content":"## To Snitch or to Stick Together? A Spartan Dilemma\nImagine you are a Spartan soldier stationed at the border of Thermopylae in 300 BC, alongside your comrade, Krish. The Persian army looms on the horizon, and your commander, Leonidas, has tasked you with guarding the pass. However, the nights are long, and the temptation to rest is strong. You and Krish agree to take turns keeping watch, allowing the other to sleep. But you both know that if the Persians attack while one of you is asleep, the consequences will be dire. The commander has made it clear: if either of you fails in your duty, you will be exiled from the Spartan ranks.\n\nBut there is a catch , the commander cannot fire both of you simultaneously as he cannot afford to lose two brave soldiers at once. So, if both of you sleep , the commander will do nothing . So, both of you completely exhausted from the toil of the day decided to sleep this night. But if you sleep and Krish decides to snitch on you then he will get promoted high up the ranks as he chooses to remain true to the commander. So, he will always have the incentive to snitch on you. You cannot completely trust Krish if he will stay true upon your earlier agreement. What should you do now?\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/862/1*2vT5G009lZfPO2Z_mcVPFQ.png)\nIf you keep watch and Krish does not, he will be exiled, but you are safe. You may feel sorry for him, but at least you remain a Spartan warrior.\nOn the other hand, if Krish decides to keep watch, then you should do the same to avoid exile.\n\nBut the same reasoning applies to Krish. So, both of you sacrifice your rest and keep watch. Evidently, you would both be better off if you both remained true to your words and took turns resting. But that desirable outcome is not possible! If each of you behaves rationally — that is, does what is best for himself — keeping watch is the only reasonable thing to do. Perhaps next time, when you trust each other more, you can find a better solution.\n\nThis is a classic example of a problem of Game Theory known as **Prisoner’s Dilemma** where acting in your own self-interest or non-cooperation leads to a worse outcome for everyone but still it’s the only rational decision. Let’s break it down step by step, define the strategies, construct the payoff matrix, and identify the dominated strategy.\n\nAgain, what is **dominated strategy** and **payoff matrices**?\nIn game theory, a dominated strategy is a strategy that yields a worse outcome for a player regardless of what the other player does. In other words, no matter what strategy the opponent chooses, the player is always better off choosing a different strategy.\nA payoff matrix in game theory is like a scoreboard that shows what each player gets depending on the choices they make. It’s a simple table that helps visualize the outcomes of a game. Here to construct a simple payoff matrix lets denote the outcome of getting exiled as 0,as it is the worst outcome possible, having to keep the watch as 1, as it is better than getting exiled and getting rest as 2 which is the best outcome possible.\n\nNash Equilibrium:\nThe Nash Equilibrium occurs when no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the other player’s strategy. In this case:\nIf both players choose Keep Watch, neither can improve their payoff by switching to Rest.\n\na. If you switch to Rest, your payoff drops from 1 to 0.\nb. Similarly, if Krish switches to Rest, his payoff drops from 1 to 0.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/239/1*7vSDNd_O34nlaqtbQBY7iQ.png)\nPayoff MatrixThus, the Nash Equilibrium is for both players to Keep Watch, even though both would prefer the outcome where both Rest (which is not an equilibrium because it’s unstable — each player has an incentive to deviate).\nThe Spartan Dilemma is a clear example of the Prisoner’s Dilemma. The dominated strategy for both players is to Rest, as Keep Watch always yields a higher payoff regardless of the other player’s choice. The Nash Equilibrium is for both players to Keep Watch, even though mutual cooperation (Rest, Rest) would be preferable. This highlights the tension between individual rationality and collective benefit, a central theme in game theory.\nBy analyzing this scenario with a payoff matrix and identifying the dominated strategy, we can see how game theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding strategic decision-making in conflict situations, whether on the battlefield or in everyday life.\n\n## Repetitive Games:\nThe name “game theory” is misleading. Game theory is mostly not about games (although it can also be applied to games). Rather, game theory considers any interaction among multiple parties with conflicting interests, and uses logical reasoning (and mathematics) to analyse such interactions.\nSuppose you are in 480 BC . The Spartans and Persians are at war with each other. Both countries station their armies along the shared border. The armies are positioned next to each other, on opposite sides of the border. As night falls, soldiers from both sides retreat to their barracks, hoping for a peaceful night’s rest, except for a few soldiers who stay on guard. But then, the Spartan commander Leonidas says to his deputy, “I have an idea. Since Persian army is going to sleep, this is our opportunity to strike. With all our forces, we can easily overpower their guards and launch a surprise attack while the rest of their troops are asleep. Wake up all our soldiers — we’re heading to the border!”\nThe deputy, wanting to rest, responds, “Sir, what if Persian army doesn’t sleep? Then we won’t be able to defeat them.” To which Leonidas replies, “In that case, we must go to the border; otherwise, they might strike us first!” With this solid rationale, the entire Spartan army moves to the border, prepared for battle.\nHowever, the same logical argument holds for Persian forces. They, too, march toward the border, where both armies inevitably collide in a brutal confrontation. What a senseless waste!\nSadly, this logic seems to apply night after night… so are the two armies destined for endless conflict? Does game theory suggest that constant fighting is the only rational choice?\nFortunately, the answer is no. In fact, advanced game theory analysis shows us the opposite: in such situations, logical reasoning often leads to cooperation, not endless conflict.\nHow can this be? Is there a flaw in the Leonidas reasoning? Yes and no. His logic is sound if we consider each night as an isolated event. However, when we account for the repeated nature of the conflict — night after night — the logic changes. How so?\nLet’s revisit the conversation between Leonidas and his deputy. This time, the deputy says, “Sir, yesterday while walking along the border, I encountered the deputy of Persian army. He shouted over the fence that they plan to sleep tonight, but he warned me that if we attack, they will retaliate and continue to strike us every night thereafter! I shouted back that the same applies to us.”\nNow, is attacking tonight still the best choice? Probably not. Although an attack might provide a short-term benefit, the long-term consequences of continuous battles night after night would far outweigh the initial gain. This holds true for both sides! Therefore, both armies decide not to attack and instead get some much-needed rest. The same decision is made the following night, and the night after that…\nIt becomes clear that repeated interactions change the situation entirely! While confrontation seemed the logical course in a one-off scenario, cooperation emerges as the most rational strategy when the conflict is ongoing. Game theory teaches us that cooperation is often the most logical approach in repeated situations, even between opposing and hostile parties! According to game theory, cooperation is frequently the best course of action — even if you are only concerned with your own benefit.\nThis idea of cooperation and equivalent retaliation was first introduced by **Robert Axelrod’s seminal work on the concept of “tit for tat”. **\nThe idea of “tit for tat” isn’t just some game theory concept — it’s a powerful lesson in how people (and even nature) handle cooperation and conflict. You can see it everywhere, from politics to animal behavior, shaping the way societies and relationships work. In today’s complicated world, this simple strategy reminds us that playing fair and treating others as they treat us can lead to more cooperation, understanding, and respect\n\n\n![Image](https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d81c584f50e3)\n[A Gentle Introduction To Game Theory](https://medium.com/stamatics-iit-kanpur/a-gentle-introduction-to-game-theory-d81c584f50e3) was originally published in [Stamatics, IIT Kanpur](https://medium.com/stamatics-iit-kanpur) on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.\n\n"},{"id":"the-banach-tarski-paradox","title":"The Banach-Tarski Paradox","author":"Saptarshi Mandal","date":"2025-01-26T12:37:41.000Z","content":"Banach-Tarski says that it is possible to cut up a solid sphere into pieces that by simple rotations can be rearranged into two identical spheres of the same size as the original. No trickery!\n\nIn this article we shall describe the notion of infinity, give an intuitive proof of the Banach-Tarski Paradox, and show how it challenges our definition of volume.\n\n## Axioms\nUsing logic to deduce new facts from known facts, is a vital part of mathematics. But, to apply logic, we need a starting point — a set of facts that we assume to be true, before we deduce new facts from it.\n\nThese are called Axioms. The **Axiom of Choice** is an intuitively “obvious” axiom that leads to strange, paradoxical results like the Banach-Tarski Paradox.\n\nThe **Axiom of Choice** says that given a collection of non-empty sets, it is possible to construct a new set by choosing one element from each set in the collection.\n\n## **Different Infinities**\nBefore we start talking about the theorem, it is important to illustrate that infinities come in different sizes. Cantor’s diagonal argument shows that the number of reals is greater than the number of naturals even though there are infinitely-many of both.\n\nIn particular, there are more **real numbers** between 0 and 1 than there are **natural numbers** on the entire number line.\nSay we list all infinitely-many **naturals** against the infinitely-many distinct **reals** between 0 and 1, randomly.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1nyAi6rMAvwOOZn-xgDJ_A.png)\nCantor’s diagonal argumentFrom such a listing, we can “construct” a new real number that is not in this list. Simply take the nth decimal entry of this new real number to be different from the n-th entry of the number listed against the n-th natural number.\n\nSo, in this case the number 0.05134953 differs from the 0th -number at the 0th-place, the 1st-number at the 1st-place, etc. Hence, just in between (0, 1) we have more real numbers than we have natural numbers on the entire number line.\n\nWe define the number of naturals to be **“countable”-infinite** and the number of reals as **“uncountable”-infinite**.\n\n## Holes Don’t Matter\nSay, we have a unit circle, and name a point as 0. Now, we start walking along the circle’s circumference, in steps of length 1. As the circles circumference is irrational, we’ll never step on an already stepped point. Let us name these points by the number of steps taken to reach them, namely, 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/575/1*XDrI0rdj1uNC79tBG79TXQ.png)\nNow, we delete the point marked 0, and replace it with the point marked 1. We continue by replacing the hole at 1, with the point marked 2 and so on, replacing every n-th point with the (n + 1)-th point.\n\nSince we have infinitely many such labelled points, every hole will be filled, and the circle will be completed. That is, at the end of the process, we will again have the original circle, with no evidence that one point was removed.\n\nWe can do this again, be simply choosing another 0 point. We conclude that when we remove **“countably”-infinite** points from a set of **“uncountably”-infinite** points, the number of elements of the new set is same as the number of elements of the original set.\n\n| uncountable set | = | uncountable set | — | countable set|\n\nThis idea will be useful in a later part of the proof.\n\nIn the following intuitive proof, we’ll only consider cutting and rearranging one hollow sphere into two. The idea for a solid ball is similar.\n\n## Naming points on the sphere\nConsider the following two actions on a hollow sphere.\n\nA 180◦ rotation about an axis F , denoted by f .\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/314/1*391w8dkR_euQDUvRIANqDQ.png)\nThe f actionA 120◦ rotation about an axis G, denoted by g. (The axis G is at a 45◦\nangle to the axis F)\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/326/1*UeUfoFScqdFj6QE7CyhmmQ.png)\nThe g actionSo, any string of letters f and g, denote an order of actions on the sphere.\nIt is easy to see that f² = e and g³ = e, where e is the identity action. (The\nidentity action is where the sphere remains unchanged)\n\nIf we consider the set of all strings formed using f, g in which the sub-strings “ff ” and “ggg” do not occur, we can see that each element of the set corresponds to an unique action on the sphere. Let that set be:\n\nP = {e, f, g, fg, gf, g²f, gfg, fg², fgf, . . .}; The set P is countable.\n\nWe shall now construct a paradoxical decomposition: P = I ∪ J ∪ K such that the sets I, J, K, J ∪ K are congruent.\n\nConsider the following “machine” T (function) that takes in an element of P\nand gives us a set of elements of P by appending something to it.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*a_1YWXa8g8I3jclLi3HMwA.png)\nThe T machineWith the help of the above “machine” we will outline an algorithm. This algorithm helps to break down the set P into disjoint subsets I, J, K with some special properties.\n\nThe Algorithm:\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*ruTxR6noPMXZbcu60g_gVQ.png)\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BqHMJHVIlklLaetcRISXyQ.png)\nPictorial depiction of the above algorithmWe get the following outputs:\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*v6F1h8wxIzS0xDm99CcCbQ.png)\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Wi0qiDJfdKNQvDvL7fupcA.png)\nThe special properties of congruence that I, J, K exhibit are:\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lPWxL-4OjbeRR6lNyijF8Q.png)\nHence, I, J, K, J ∪ K are congruent.\n\n## Decomposing the sphere\nNow, we shall partition the sphere. Let the set of points on the sphere be S.\n\n**Observation**: Whenever we rotate a sphere, there are exactly two points that stay put, namely, the poles.\n\n**Observation**: Each action in P , except the identity, is also a rotation, so for\neach action we will have two fixed points.\n\nLet us collect all those countably many fixed points or poles into a set D.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TEBorRdYul2S84KwHwTgVg.png)\nThe sets S \\ D and DTo all the uncountably many points in S \\ D, we apply the actions in P . For a\npoint x, we get P(x) = {x, f x, gx, fgx, gfx, g²f x, gfgx, fg²x, fgf x, . . .}\n\n**Observation**: For any two points, x ≠ y on the sphere, either P(x) = P(y) or\nP(x) ∩ P(y) = ∅. So, we get an equivalence relation, that induces a partition on S \\ D.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JsbLmwK-XTlMgL4rfzNubQ.png)\nThe equivalence relation used to decompose the sphereNow, we create a set M by picking one element from each partition of S \\ D\nand putting it in M . It is evident that by applying P to M , we get S \\ D.\n\nSince, we have already decomposed P , and now have a “representative set” M that gives S \\ D when we apply P to it, we have decomposed S \\ D as follows:\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-5VeoJYdk4lNEDSIGJ0Dcg.png)\n## Rearranging the pieces\nOn the pieces that we decomposed the sphere into, we apply the following rotations:\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rCOpgLy7mq0DHe_xWyQoKw.png)\nHere is a pictorial depiction of the rearrangement.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*F8Y70MPpmO2vFpZ-MAYB_w.png)\nThe only thing that remains to add is the countably-infinite points D for the\nsecond sphere. But, we have already demonstrated that a sphere and a sphere with D removed are equivalent, using the circle analogy.\n\nThis concludes the sketch.\n\n## The Axiom of Choice\nWe had to invoke the Axiom of Choice in the creation of the set M . It’s creation was crucial in decomposing the sphere.\n\nProofs using the Axiom of Choice are totally non-constructive in nature. That is, we simply are guaranteed an existence of an object, in this case the set M , with no information as to how to create it.\n\nThe Banach-Tarski Paradox, hints at the existence of sets inside R³ that challenges our definition of volume. For example, the set I, J, K are congruent, and seemingly should have the same volume. However, on rotating I by 180◦ , we get f(I) which has the same volume as J ∪ K. The volume of set I changes on rotation!\n\nThis means we need a much more rigorous definition of “volume” that does not betray us, like the naive definition does in this case!\n\n***References***:\n\n1. *Wikipedia*: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach–Tarski_paradox\n\n2. *ETHZ*: [https://people.math.ethz.ch/~fdalio/BanachTarskiTheorem.pdf](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~fdalio/BanachTarskiTheorem.pdf)\n\n3. *Vsauce*: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s86-Z-CbaHA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s86-Z-CbaHA)\n\n\n![Image](https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=fc5b981a8d61)\n[The Banach-Tarski Paradox](https://medium.com/stamatics-iit-kanpur/the-banach-tarski-paradox-fc5b981a8d61) was originally published in [Stamatics, IIT Kanpur](https://medium.com/stamatics-iit-kanpur) on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.\n\n"},{"id":"simpson-s-paradox-the-mirage-of-data-science","title":"SIMPSON’S PARADOX : THE MIRAGE OF DATA SCIENCE","author":"Swarnim Verma","date":"2025-01-11T12:01:58.000Z","content":"## Simpson’s Paradox : The Mirage Of Data Science\n## The Great War of Mathematics\nLet’s journey back in time to the year **1711**.\n\nYou find yourself in the midst of **The Great War of Mathematics**, a fierce intellectual battle fought between two legendary nemeses: **Isaac Newton** and **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz**. Don’t worry — you’re perfectly safe here (no arrows of logic or razor-sharp deductions will harm you).\n\nBoth titans wield armies of unimaginable power, consisting of **axioms** and** theorems**, ready to clash for mathematical supremacy. Have you ever wondered what a true battlefield of mathematics might look like? If not, let’s imagine it today!\n\nSince childhood, I’ve dreamed of having a hypothesis named after me. Guess what? I’ve concocted this completely nonsensical one here 😅.\n\n**With that, I invite you to embark on a journey through my hypothetical world, where math is not just theory — it’s warfare.**\n\n## The Setup\n**Axioms** are like fearless infantry, forming the foundation of the army.**Theorems** are the cavalry, swift and powerful, riding in to secure victory.**Newton’s** army boasts a formidable force of infantry*** N_i*** and cavalry ***N_c***. Meanwhile, **Leibniz’s** troops are equally valiant, with infantry ***L_i ***and cavalry ***L_c***. Both armies are of the **same total strength**, setting the stage for a balanced confrontation.\n\nThe battlefield is set. The war rages on for five long years, filled with intellectual maneuvers, strategic deductions, and relentless battles of wits. But in** 1716**, just as **Leibniz’s** forces seem poised for victory, disaster strikes. The great **Leibniz** — *not by logic or a rival theorem, but by a cruel irony* — *misplaces his spectacles* and vanishes from the battlefield, leaving his ideas to falter.\n\nBoth armies suffer tremendous losses over the course of this great war of ideas. As a renowned mathematician in this hypothetical world, I now turn to the statistics that reveal the true scale of these intellectual casualties. Let’s examine the graph below, where we begin to unravel the mystery behind the staggering losses on both sides.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/977/0*mzHZ_HGW3bw4D-Uo)\nFigure 1## The front that suffered fewer casualties was victorious.\n**Which side do you think suffered greater casualties?**\n\nMany of you might assume that Newton’s side took the brunt of the losses, especially since both his infantry and cavalry suffered a higher percentage of casualties. The evidence seems clear — Newton’s forces appeared to be in far worse shape.\n\n**But Newton did not lose!!!!**\n\nThis revelation struck me like a thunderclap. I, too, was shaken by the truth of it. Yet, the data does not lie. When I examined the overall statistics, the outcome was irrefutable. Those still skeptical of my words, I invite you to glance through the following graph.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/977/0*NBzvK9hVis7MGEp4)\nFigure 2**“Overall casualty rate of Newton could be less than that of Leibniz if at least one of the Newton’s regiment’s casualty rate had been less than that of Leibniz . There was no way that the weighted average of casualty rates could show such contrary results.”**— Common SenseNow, I ask you to take a moment and reflect on where the anomaly might lie. Why does our common sense seem to betray us? How could Newton’s side, despite higher casualties in both infantry and cavalry, emerge victorious?\n\nThe timing is perfect for a revelation!\n\nBrace yourself — here’s the formal definition of **Simpson’s Paradox**:\n\n## **Simpson’s paradox is a phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.**\nWhile you ponder this, let us dive deeper into the demographics of both armies. Understanding the makeup of ***Newton* **and** *Leibniz’s*** forces may provide the key to unraveling this perplexing paradox.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/977/0*RNBsov83hMFVEEde)\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/977/0*KAmPM0Y2FGeAMl3y)\nNotice the stark difference between the two armies. After examining these pie charts, the entire paradox unraveled before my eyes, reducing itself to nothing more than a simple oversight — confounding variables. Do you see it? Let me explain.\n\n**Confounding variables* are factors that influence other variables in such a way that they create misleading or distorted associations between them.***Earlier, we **failed **to account for a crucial variable: the composition of the army. Once we incorporate the effect of this, the mystery dissolves, and we arrive at a remarkably intuitive explanation for the Simpson’s Paradox we encountered earlier.\n\n## WAS IT REALLY A PARADOX ?\nAlthough **Newton’s **infantry suffered a higher casualty rate than **Leibniz’s**, it made up only 20% of **Newton’s** army. In other words, while nearly all soldiers in **Newton’s** infantry regiment perished, the regiment itself was relatively small.\n\nIn contrast, **Leibniz’s** army had a much larger proportion of infantry, with a significant casualty rate of around 50%. This combination of a larger infantry proportion and a higher casualty rate contributed to the overall casualty rate of **Leibniz’s **army surpassing that of **Newton’s.**\n\nLets put the Mathematics going behind in front of you.\n\nFrom the graphs, the following observations are very straightforward:\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0VpbEryqjHZxEyLQevkQqQ.png)\nAnd you see, the mathematical results are consistent with the [figure 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5e9980b-b348-4fae-985c-fd65bae891a2) .\n\n**If data can be partitioned in such a way that a single Simpson’s reversal emerges, then, logically, it seems inevitable that this reversal will continue as the data is divided even further.**This very phenomenon is vividly illustrated in Figure 3, where the casualty rates of four distinct military units are laid bare: **Infantry I **(the swordsmen of the first battalion),** Infantry II** (the archers of the second battalion), **Cavalry I** (the nimble, lightly armored cavalry), and **Cavalry II** (the mighty, heavily armored cavalry). With this partitioning, the data splits into four subsets, each telling its own tale. In every single one, **Leibniz’s** battalion suffers greater casualties than **Newton’s **— at least, that’s what the numbers suggest.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/977/0*4GQfD0T0SMLUF8uY)\nFigure 3Yet, as we zoom out and aggregate the data to the level of regiments, the tides begin to shift, and we encounter Figure 1. Here, a stunning reversal occurs —** Leibniz’s** army now appears to have outperformed **Newton’s!** But the twists do not end there. As we continue to aggregate the data, adding more layers, the final conclusion arrives, and once again, it’s **Newton’s** army that emerges victorious considering the overall casualty rate.\n\n**Simpson’s paradox* says however that this can occur; it is possible for any relation between two variables to be reversed in every component subpopulation***This chain of reversals begs the ultimate question: **Which army truly proved superior?**\n\nI now present you with even **more detailed demographics** of both armies and leave it to you to verify the trend reversal we’ve just witnessed.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/977/0*bq8DWw73EqY-dbSJ)\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/977/0*0VLPV0qjapWrp6uM)\nDo you want to hear one more truth?\n\n**Newton **and **Leibniz **never participated in any actual wars 😜 . While their intellectual battle over the discovery of calculus is legendary, they never fought on a physical battlefield. This fact serves as a powerful reminder to snap us out of the hypothetical world we’ve been exploring.\n\n## Time to be serious\nIt’s time to set aside our imaginative scenarios and consider the true implications of Simpson’s Paradox. You might be wondering: **How does Simpson’s Paradox manifest itself in the real world?**\n\nIt turns out, this paradox isn’t just a theoretical quirk — it appears in practical situations more often than you might think. Even during the **COVID-19 pandemic**, Simpson’s Paradox emerged: when comparing Case Fatality Rates (CFR) between China and Italy, Italy initially seemed to have a higher survival rate, but when the data was split by age group, the conclusion flipped.\n\nFor now, let’s focus on one of the most well-known examples — a study comparing two approaches for treating kidney stones.\n\nA study by statistician **Steven A. Julious** and senior statistical programmer **Mark A. Mullee** compares two kidney stone treatments: one cutting-edge and minimally invasive, the other a reliable, long-standing method. The success rates, sorted by stone size, suggest a **clear winner**.\n\n**But is there more to consider?**\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/483/0*SR1zzEwi0yB7C2-7)\nReference:\n\nSteven A. Julious and Mark A. Mullee (3 December 1994). *Confounding and Simpson’s paradox*. BMJ, 309(6967): 1480–1481. doi: [10.1136/bmj.309.6967.1480](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.309.6967.1480).

PMID: [7804052](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7804052/).\n\n## Unraveling the Mystery: The Simpson’s Paradox at Work\nLet’s break this down step by step. At first glance, the data seems pretty straightforward. When you look at the treatments for small and large stones separately, the outcome is clear — **treatment A** consistently outperforms treatment B for both small and large stones. So far, so good, right? Treatment A is the obvious winner in each case.\n\nBut here’s where things take an unexpected turn: when you combine the data for both small and large stones together, suddenly **treatment B **looks like the better treatment overall.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/630/0*ekTSlZa9K_uP0qGn)\n**This seeming contradiction is rooted in the distribution of the data.**\n\nHere’s what happened:\n\nMore patients with **small stones**, (which are generally easier to treat) were assigned **treatment B**. At the same time, a larger proportion of patients with **large stones,** (which are much harder to treat successfully) were assigned **treatment A**. **The size of the kidney stone, it turns out, has a much greater impact on treatment success than the choice of treatment itself.** Smaller stones have a much higher chance of success, regardless of which treatment is used.\n\nWhen we combine the groups, it creates an illusion that treatment B is more effective because more patients with small stones received it, and those patients had higher success rates. **But if the distribution of patients between the two treatments had been more balanced, this paradox would not have appeared.**\n\nThis is exactly why you can’t always trust the overall numbers without considering how the data is divided. **Without factoring in the size of the kidney stone, you might draw the wrong conclusions.**\n\n**This lesson extends beyond kidney stone treatments** — it’s a reminder that data can be misleading if not carefully interpreted. The numbers may seem clear at first, but they can hide deeper truths. Simpson’s Paradox teaches us to question assumptions and dig deeper before drawing conclusions.\n\n[**Do still you believe the statistical phenomenon described above should be considered a paradox?**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson&#39;s_paradox#Criticism)\n\nAlthough criticized, Simpson’s paradox remains a fascinating and frequently explored topic in statistics and data analysis. Its ongoing study across diverse disciplines highlights the importance of nuanced statistical methods and the dangers of oversimplifying data interpretations.\n\nReferences:\n\n**Simpson’s Paradox and Investment Management :**[ Research paper by *Gilbert W.

By the end of this article, you would know what the problem is, and how we can use Markov Chains to solve it.\n\nThe set up is as given below:\n\nThere are 4 blocks, with 5 corners, say 1,2,3,4 and 5. A drunkard starts at a given corner. His home is at 1, and there is a bar at 5. If he is at 1 or 5, he stays there, but if he is at 2,3 or 4, then with equal probability, he may go to the left or to the right. Hence the corners — 1,2,3,4 and 5 are the states the drunkard can be at.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JLOUcZwjezqrbhxHcYh4Vw.jpeg)\nFirst let us ask -\n\nGiven a starting state, what is the probability that the drunkard reaches 1 or 5 in a given number of steps(Q0)? Will the drunkard always reach one of these states(Q1)?\n\nBefore we dive into this and many other interesting questions, let us revisit what a Markov Chain is and look at what an absorbing Markov Chain is.\n\n**Markov Chains and absorbing Markov Chains**\n\nAs we saw in the previous article, a Markov chain has, ‘n’ many states, which are denoted by s_i (where i goes from 1 to n), and a Transition Matrix, P, which denotes the probabilities of going from one state to the other, i.e. each element of P, p_ij, represents the probability of going from state s_i to state s_j in one step.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*xgsxEKNl4Cetl7eW)\nFrom the given definitions, it can be obtained that the (ij)th element of the matrix P^n, is the probability of reaching the state, s_j, in n many steps, starting at the state, s_i. (Does this answer our first question about the Drunkard’s walk? — Q0)\n\nIn Drunkard’s walk, the states are 1,2,3,4 and 5, and it is not possible to leave 1, and 5. Such states are called absorbing states. *An absorbing Markov Chain is a special kind of Markov Chain, which has at least one absorbing state, such that that state can be reached from any other state*. The Markov Chain we get from the Drunkard’s walk set up, is an absorbing Markov Chain.\n\nIn an absorbing Markov Chain, there are two kinds of states:\n\n*Absorbing States*: from which it is impossible to leave*Transient States*: the states which are not absorbingHere 1 and 5 are absorbing states and 2,3 and 4 are transient states. Since it is impossible to leave states 1 and 5, and if the man is at 2,3 or 4, there is equal probability to go left or right, we obtain the Transition Matrix for the Drunkard’s walk as follows:\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*ECh_4t45oZ9R7eex)\n**The canonical form of the Transition matrix:**\n\nLet the number of transient states be t and the number of absorbing states be r. For any Absorbing Markov Chain, the states can be rearranged, such that the Transient states come first and the Absorbing states later — to obtain the Transition Matrix in the form:\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*IdLzp48X_rxGDiwv)\nwhere I is the (r x r) identity matrix, R is a (t x r) matrix, Q is a (t x t) matrix, and 0 is the (r x t) zero matrix. This is known as the canonical form of the transition matrix, and the canonical form of the transition matrix for the Drunkard’s Walk is:\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*p4mU4QB609fP9NBx)\n*Why are we looking at this form of the transition matrix? How does it help us?*\n\nObserve that when we write the transition matrix, P, in such a form, we get a very neat representation for P^n in terms of Q,R,I and 0. I encourage you to try it out on your own and find this form for yourself.\n\nAdditionally, the canonical form of the transition matrix proves useful in solving some problems concerning the Absorbing Markov Chain, which we will see in the next section!\n\n**What are the key questions we have for an Absorbing Markov Chain?**\n\nThere are mainly 4 questions that we can ask for a given Absorbing Markov Chain:\n\nQ1) The Probability of Absorption\n\nirrespective of which state we start in, will we always end up in an absorbing state? What do you think?A simple argument to show that *Q^n approaches 0* will show us that whichever state we start at, we will always reach an absorbing state.Q2) Since, the answer to the above problem is yes, the next question that comes to mind is what is the expected number of times we will be in a given state, given a starting state, up till absorption. (note that we count the initial state if i=j)\n\nThis is a question of expectation. Suppose we are trying to find the number of times that we will be in state s_j, given that we are starting at s_i.If s_i or s_j is an absorbing state, then this problem is trivial. Hence let us assume that both of the states are transient states.Observe that the required number will be the sum of the (ij)th element of I, Q, Q², Q³, and so on, giving us an infinite sum.We can find the value of this expression, by finding the sum, I+Q+Q²+Q³+…, which happens to be (I-Q)^(-1).For further reference, let us call this matrix as N.\n\nQ3) We can also ask the question of time — how long does it take before reaching an absorbing state (on average)?\n\nOnce we have answered the question of how many times we will be in a given state, finding out the time it takes before absorption, becomes a fairly straightforward problem to answer.We simply have to add the expected number of times we will be in each state(we know this from Q2), over s_j, fixing s_i — that will give us the total time.Q4) Last but not the least, we ask the probability of being absorbed in each of the absorbing states.\n\nSuppose we start at the transient state, s_i. The probability of being absorbed in the absorbing state, s_j, is the probability that we reach s_j at any point in time, as once we reach there, we will never leave that state.The number of times we will be in any given state, s_k is N_ik and the probability of being absorbed into s_j, given we are at s_k is R_kj. To get the total probability of absorption in s_j, we need to add N_ik * R_kj over all the possible s_k’s. Hence we can find this probability from the matrix, B=NR.(Do observe that the solutions to both 3 and 4, and hence all of the problems, can be written in a matrix form, using N,R, and Q)\n\nI encourage you to use these approaches to answer these problems for the example of the Drunkard’s Walk!\n\n*This series is inspired by Prof. Jaideep Mulherkar during the duration of the course, ‘Calculus 3 — Linear Algebra’, MITES Summer 2024*\n\n*Reference:*\n\n[prob.pdf (dartmouth.edu)](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf)\n\n\n![Image](https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=bfbcf19ab9a0)\n[The Drunkard’s Walk and Absorbing Markov Chains](https://medium.com/stamatics-iit-kanpur/the-drunkards-walk-and-absorbing-markov-chains-bfbcf19ab9a0) was originally published in [Stamatics, IIT Kanpur](https://medium.com/stamatics-iit-kanpur) on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.\n\n"},{"id":"introduction-to-markov-chains-an-intersection-of-probability-and-linear-algebra","title":"Introduction to Markov Chains: An Intersection of Probability and Linear Algebra","author":"Sruthi Subramanian","date":"2024-07-13T18:28:10.000Z","content":"**What will the weather be tomorrow?**\n\nWhether it rains or not is a concern a lot of us have in our everyday life.

Let us now dive into a simple probability problem that revolves around this.\n\nIf you knew the probabilities of the weather being Rainy, Nice or Snowy tomorrow(or one day later), given the weather today(either Rainy, Nice or Snowy), how would you go about finding out the probability of it being Rainy the day after tomorrow, given that it is Nice today(or if it is Snowy or Rainy today)?\n\nLet our example’s probabilities be as follows:\n\nThe probability that it is** Rainy** tomorrow, given that it is **Rainy** today = 0.5\n\nThe probability that it is **Nice** tomorrow, given that it is **Rainy** today = 0.25\n\nThe probability that it is **Snowy** tomorrow, given that it is** Rainy** today = 0.25\n\nThe probability that it is **Rainy** tomorrow, given that it is** Nice **today = 0.5\n\nThe probability that it is **Nice** tomorrow, given that it is** Nice** today = 0\n\nThe probability that it is **Snowy** tomorrow, given that it is** Nice** today = 0.5\n\nThe probability that it is** Rainy** tomorrow, given that it is **Snowy** today = 0.25\n\nThe probability that it is **Nice** tomorrow, given that it is **Snowy** today = 0.25\n\nThe probability that it is **Snowy** tomorrow, given that it is **Snowy** today = 0.5\n\nGiven today’s weather (say Rainy), observe that the sum of the probabilities of it being Rainy, Nice and Snowy tomorrow is 1 (0.5+0.25+0.25). Why must this be the case?\n\n(Note that we assume that these probabilities don’t change from day to day, and remain same for any two consecutive days)\n\nNow the next question that arises is, given today’s weather, what are the probabilities for it to be Rainy/Nice/Snowy two days later? Or three days later? Or to generalize this problem, how about **n **days later?\n\nFirst let us look at the specific problem: **What is the probability that it is Rainy two days later, given that it is Nice today?**\n\nUsing the basic concepts of probability, we can approach this problem as follows.\n\nThere are three possible cases that arise here:\n\nIt is Rainy tomorrow and Rainy two days later, given that it is nice todayFor which the probability is\n\nP(Rainy tomorrow|Nice today) * P(Rainy day after tomorrow|Rainy tomorrow)\n\n= P(Rainy tomorrow|Nice today) * P(Rainy tomorrow|Rainy today)\n\n= 0.5*0.5 = 0.25\n\nIt is Nice tomorrow and Rainy two days later, given that it is nice todayFor which the probability is\n\nP(Nice tomorrow|Nice today) * P(Rainy day after tomorrow|Nice tomorrow)\n\n= 0*0.5 = 0\n\nIt is Snowy tomorrow and Rainy two days later, given that it is nice todayFor which the probability is\n\nP(Snowy tomorrow|Nice today) * P(Rainy day after tomorrow|Snowy tomorrow)\n\n= 0.5*0.25 = 0.125\n\nHence the probability that it is Rainy the day after tomorrow given that it is nice today, is the sum of these three probabilities, which is 0.375.\n\nNow this seems like a fairly good method to use to find the probability with a day gap. What if we want to find the probability for 4 days later? Taking cases will become a very tedious and time-consuming process, and could also be very confusing. Do observe that while this is likely to be taxing for a human, this is the kind of problem that a computer would do very well!\n\nNow, using a matrix approach to solve this problem, will allow us to keep track of all the probability values and take care of all these cases in a much more organized manner. This is where the idea of Markov Chains comes in!\n\n**How can we solve this problem with matrices?**\n\nLet us try to represent the given probabilities in a matrix form. Let the (ij)th element of the matrix represent the probability that it is in the state (**s**_j) tomorrow given that it is in the state (**s**_i) today.\n\nNote that the states, in this case are the possible weathers it can be:\n\ns_1 = R (Rainy). s_2 = N (Nice). s_3 = S (Snowy).\n\nThe row of the element represents the weather today, and the column represents the weather tomorrow(or one day later), for which we are looking at the probability.\n\nConstructing such a matrix, we get:\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/193/0*NWHj4FnIsIoMnFc-)\nLet this matrix be P. If we take P^2, we have:\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/202/0*TVrUHqD31-jRTwT4)\nRemember that our problem was to find the probability that it is Rainy two days later, given that it is Nice today.\n\nObserve that the element in the second row, representing that it is Nice today, and the first column, representing that it is Rainy (two days later?), is 0.375, which is the same that we calculated previously, by taking cases.\n\nHow does this value come?\n\nFrom matrix multiplication, we know that we calculate the corresponding element of the matrix, P^2 , by taking the inner product of the second row of P with the first column of P, which is:(0.5*0.5 + 0*0.5 + 0.5*0.25) = 0.375\n\nSee that the first term represents the probability such that the intermediate day is Rainy, while the next two terms do the same for Nice and Snowy.Writing this out, and taking all the possible cases, we can show that, in general, the (ij)th element of P^2 represents the probability that the weather two days later(or the day after tomorrow) is s_j, given that it is s_i today.**What is a Markov Chain?**\n\nThe sequence of the matrices P^n (n>0) is called a Markov Chain. The Matrix, P, is called the Transition matrix. In a general Markov Chain, the states can be anything, and we can have any number of states. (Do observe that as the number of states increases, the computation for finding the powers of the matrix P, becomes more complicated).\n\nLet our Markov Chain have **n **many states. Then the transition matrix, will be a (n x n) matrix, where the (ij)th element, represents the probability of the state s_j occurring tomorrow(or one day later) given that s_i is today’s state. If the transition matrix is P, then in P^n, the (ij)th element represents the same probability for the n days later.\n\nThere are various types of Markov Chains, including Absorbing Markov Chains, and Regular Markov Chains, and they have various interesting properties. Those are some interesting things to look forward to in the upcoming articles!

We used to have numerous competitions to see who could do it fastest, and being able to solve it swiftly, earned you a little extra respect from all your friends (who didn’t know the trick).\n\nAll the cube solvers would know that we generally follow an algorithm to solve the cube. We have a list of possible states of the cube, and then we choose an algorithm to follow, based on which state it is in. (As you probably have figured by now, I too once was mesmerized by that colorful puzzle.)\n\nIn this article, we will be looking into why this works mathematically.\n\nWhat is used here is something called group theory. Let us look into what group theory actually is, and how it can be used here :)\n\n**So what is a Group?**\n\nLet us first look at some examples before we go into the definition of a group. Mathematicians came up with groups with the aim to classify symmetries. These could be for any shape, 2-D or 3-D or even more! The actions that maintained the shape were all put into a structure, we call a group.\n\nLet us understand one specific such group, called a dihedral group.Consider a square. Observe that the set of rotations by 90°, 180°, 270° and 360°, along with reflection about its axis of symmetry, does not change the orientation of the square. Through these operations, we can generate 8 squares, as given below. These together form a group which is commonly known as the dihedral group (Dn), with n=4.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/663/0*mL0WUZePi4DpTc0c)\nWe can have similar groups for other regular polygons like triangles or pentagons.\n\nLet us now try to arrange 3 distinct objects in a specific order. We can see that there are a total of 6 ways to arrange them.\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/970/0*NwAE9YySQlqCt5Cu)\nTogether these permutations form a group. Each element of the group is a bijective function from {1,2,3} to {1,2,3}\n\nSimilarly we have groups for any number of distinct objects, and the group for n objects is called Sn. These groups are of special significance as they contain all the other finite groups in them. Also, using these groups we can show that while we have expressions for the solutions of polynomial equations up to order 4, we do not have such an expression for a fifth order polynomial. Feel free to check out the youtube video in the references for a better understanding!\n\nNow let us see how a group is defined. A group is simply a set, with a binary operation(⋅). The binary operation along with the set, follows some properties, like closure(if a and b are in the group, then a⋅b is also in the group) and associativity(for a,b,c, elements in the group, a⋅(b⋅c)=(a⋅b)⋅c). Additionally, the group has an identity, which when operated with any element, gives back that element. Also, every element has an inverse, which when it is operated with, we get the identity. Note that in a group, the identity element is unique, and for each element there is a unique inverse.Another example of a group is all the integers, with + as the operation. Note that here the identity will be 0, and the inverse for any element, x, will be -x. Groups are abstract, and they are used in mathematics to study various other things, as they have a particular structure, which we can use to characterize them.**How are we using groups here?**\n\nIn the case of solving a Rubik’s cube, we create a group, containing the possible moves as the elements. The group would contain R(right), L(left), U(up), D(down), F(front) and B(back), which tell us which face to rotate. We will fix the direction of rotation, say as clockwise. Then using the inverses of these elements, we can represent anti-clockwise rotation. Each of these elements changes the position of some of the cubicles on the cube. We can easily observe which cubicles go where for each of the operations.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*dvGLR1SH-xKVccNF)\nIn this group, our binary operation will be composition. So, what we do is we compose multiple moves in a particular order. And since we know what each move does to the cubicles, using that, we can deduce where each cubicle goes after the composition of some elements.\n\nNow, usually, the cube is solved layer by layer, which means that first we solve it such that all the colors in one layer are in sync, then we do the same thing for the second layer, then we finally solve the third layer and we are done.\n\nOne challenge we face is that when we decide which elements in which order we want to compose for the first layer, it is fairly easy, because we need to worry about only where those 9 cubicles move. The other cubicles will also change positions in the process, but we don’t really care about them when we are solving for the first layer.\n\nThis becomes a problem for the subsequent layers, because we need to ensure that the first layer stays intact when we are solving the second layer, and the first and second layers should stay intact when we are solving the third layer. This puts extra constraints on our algorithm, i.e., on the elements we compose to achieve the desired output. Hence as we decide which movements to do when solving a layer, we need to keep in mind how all the cubicles are moving. The group theory abstraction of the moves in a cube helps us to do that efficiently.\n\nIf you are interested in details of how the group looks and how the elements look, or if you want to see how simple (or complicated) the algorithm really is, I would encourage you to check out the paper given in the references, by Courtney Cooke, Rhode Island College!\n\nReferences:\n\n[Group theory, abstraction, and the 196,883-dimensional monster (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH0oCDa74tE)\n\n[https://digitalcommons.ric.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1164&context=honors_projects](https://digitalcommons.ric.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1164&context=honors_projects#:~:text=The%20set%20of%20moves%20of,is%20a%20move%20as%20well)\n\n[Counting Methods, Permutations, and Combinations (gmatfree.com)](https://www.gmatfree.com/module-999/counting-methods/)\n\nThis article is based on a project offered by Stamatics, IIT Kanpur, in 2023, ‘Solving the Rubik’s Cube using Group Theory’.\n\n\n![Image](https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=9f5ec5d088df)\n[Solving the Rubik’s cube using group theory](https://medium.com/stamatics-iit-kanpur/solving-the-rubiks-cube-using-group-theory-9f5ec5d088df) was originally published in [Stamatics, IIT Kanpur](https://medium.com/stamatics-iit-kanpur) on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.\n\n"},{"id":"fibonacci-numbers-and-some-of-its-applications","title":"Fibonacci Numbers and Some of its Applications","author":"Sruthi Subramanian","date":"2024-01-28T16:52:37.000Z","content":"**What is the Fibonacci Sequence?**The Fibonacci Sequence, is defined as the follows: F(n) + F(n−1) = F(n+1) for n ≥ 1, and F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, where F(n) represents the nth term of the sequence. It can also be written as 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,…. It was inspired by the Rabbit Problem, which is discussed in Section 4.\n\n**2. The Fibonacci Bamboozlement**\n\nLet us first look into a problem which we can possibly solve using the properties of the Fibonacci sequence. Consider a square of length 8. Split that into triangle and trapezoids as shown in figure (a).\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/348/1*PLEOcCYPQ6zAxJwYi_PqDg.png)\nIf we rearrange these pieces, we can form a rectangle of length, 13 and breadth, 5.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/390/1*-jzgVy4fzEGh40q5VrxYcA.png)\nNow compare the areas of these two quadrilaterals. Figure (a) has an area of 64 units, while figure (b) has an area of 65 units. Did we just create one unit of area? Read on to find out!\n\n**3. Some properties of the sequence**\n\nThere are many interesting properties of this sequence, some of which we will explore below:\n\n3.1. The Golden Ratio\n\nThe ratio between two consecutive numbers in the sequence, F(n+1)/F(n), approaches a constant value as n approaches infinity. This value is called the Golden Ratio and its value is around 1.618 (it is exactly (√5 +1)/2). You are encouraged to put the values of the terms of the sequence into Excel and calculate and see for yourself that the ratio of consecutive terms does indeed converge to this value as n becomes larger.\n\n3.2. Binet’s Formula\n\nWhat should we do if we want to find an element of the sequence? One approach would be to start from F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1 and use the recursive relation to find further elements. This would work for a small value of n, say 5, for which we need to further calculate only F(2), F(3), F(4) and F(5). But this method is not feasible for larger numbers, say for n=100 or 1000. This is where Binet’s Formula comes in. It is a formula through which we can directly find any element of the Fibonacci Sequence, without having to follow the iterative process that will follow from the recursive formula in the definition of the sequence.\n\nThe Binet Formula is given as follows:\n\nF(n) = (Φ^n−ϕ^n)/√5\n\nwhere (√5+1)/2 = Φ, (1− √5)/2 = −ϕ, Φ is the Golden Ratio and ϕ is the conjugate of the Golden Ratio.\n\n3.3. Cassini’s Identity\n\nThe Cassini’s Identity gives a relation between 3 consecutive Fibonacci numbers. It is stated as follows:\n\nF(n+1)F(n−1) − F(n)² = (-1)^n\n\nIt can be derived by defining a Q matrix, finding the general form for its nth power, and applying properties of determinants\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/218/1*LEzXiRI-CIIMhPGuakMZ0A.png)\n3.4. The Fibonacci Spiral\n\nThe Fibonacci Spiral is a geometric representation of the sequence, constructed using the following property of the Fibonacci sequence (which can be proved by Mathematical Induction):\n\nF(1)²+F(2)²+…+F(n)² = F(n)F(n+1)\n\nWe start with two tiles of area 1, placed adjacent to each other. From the formula, we know that the length of this rectangle formed will be F(n+1). So we add a square of side F(n+1) to the figure, with the side attached to the length of our initial rectangle. Now the total figure is another rectangle with length F(n+2). We will now add a square of length F(n+2) and continue this process. By drawing a spiral through the corners of these tiles, we get the Fibonacci spiral:\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/401/1*n-3XwvvsKGYbzeLpnKRXgQ.png)\n**4. Rabbit Problem**\n\n4.1. Problem\n\nA man put a male-female pair of newly born rabbits in a field. It is given that Rabbits take one month to mature, before mating. One month after mating, the female rabbit gives birth to a male female pair, and then they mate again. No rabbits die. How many pairs of rabbits are there after one year?\n\n4.2. Solution\n\nConsider the number of pairs of juvenile rabbits, adult rabbits, and total rabbits in each month. Note that: The number of pairs of juvenile rabbits in each month will be the number of pairs of adult rabbits in the previous month, and the number of pairs of adult rabbits in a given month will be the sum of the number of pairs of adult rabbits and juvenile rabbits of the previous month. Now we are given that in the first month, we have 1 pair of juvenile rabbits and 0 pairs of adult rabbits. Using these conditions, we can calculate the number of pairs after one year.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/887/1*L8z3gbvxVpVJ01GB3TmhQw.png)\nObserve that the sequence of the number of rabbit pairs in each month gives us the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n**5. Staircase Problem**\n\nIn how many ways can one climb a staircase of n steps taking either one or two steps at a time? Climbing a staircase of n stairs is the same as taking one step and then climbing a staircase of (n-1) stairs or taking two steps and then climbing a staircase of (n-2) stairs. From here, the problem can be directly connected to the Fibonacci sequence, as this problem too follows the same rule, F(n)=F(n−1) + F(n−2). The only difference will be in the initial condition, here we can climb a staircase of one step in 1 way, while we can climb a staircase of 2 steps, in 2 ways(either take two steps or take one step twice). So the ways we can climb a staircase with n steps will be F(n+1).\n\n**6. Neighbour Swapping**\n\n6.1. Problem\n\nConsider a string of the first n natural numbers. 12345..n Allow each number in the string to either stay fixed or change places with one of its neighbours. How many different strings can be formed?\n\n6.2. Solution\n\nTry this in a similar manner as the staircase problem. The number of such strings is F(n+1).\n\n**7. Fibonacci in Nature**\n\nThe number of petals on a flower is generally a Fibonacci Number. Fibonacci numbers are also seen in the arrangement of leaves on plants. The Fibonacci spiral is seen in various fruits and vegetables including pineapples, bananas and cauliflowers. The spiral is also seen in pine cones and in some flowers. We can observe it even in humans, for example, the ratio of the length of our forearm, to our palm length is close to the golden ratio. Check it out for yourself!\n\n**8. Reality of the Fibonacci Bamboozlement**\n\nCassini’s identity can be used to understand this problem. Observe that in our problem (refer Section 2), the side lengths which were 5, 8 and 13, are consecutive Fibonacci Numbers. From Cassini’s identity, we can understand that the difference between such cases of quadrilaterals will be 1. If k is taken as even, then the rectangle will have an area that is 1 unit more than the square.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/658/1*NL0XhPMgfr8lE2QcqpIYIg.png)\nThe slopes of the 2 hypotenuses vary. As we increase n, the slopes(which are actually the ratio of the consecutive Fibonacci numbers) converge to the same value, i.e. the golden ratio. As the values of the slopes become similar, the gap appears less obvious.\n\n**9.
